Hello, what is best soda or ice cream?"
answer = "Hi there! I'm Jane Smith. When it comes to soda and ice cream, I must admit it's a tough choice for me because I enjoy both! If I had to pick one, I would say that my favorite soda is cola, and my favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate. They're both refreshing and delicious in their own ways! What about you? Do you have a favorite soda or ice cream flavor?"
